Beligian-holidays

Add Federal and Wallon holidays in the emacs calendar.

* Installation:

M-x package-install RET belgian-holidays RET

* Configuration:

To use `balgian-holidays' in your calendar

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (setq holiday-other-holidays holiday-belgian-national-holidays-fr)
#+end_src

If you'd like to add local and regional holidays, pick additional holidays
from 'holiday-walloon-regional-holidays-fr' or 'carnaval-carnieres-fr'.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (setq holiday-other-holidays
        (append belgian-remarkable-days-fr carnaval-carnieres-fr))
  (setq calendar-holidays
        (append holiday-belgian-national-holidays-fr holiday-walloon-regional-holidays-fr holiday-other-holidays))
#+end_src

* Nice to have.
I live and work in Wallonia, so I did not put the dates for the Flemish region and the German-speaking region.
I also participate in the carnval of my commune, so I put the dates there, others could also be added.
